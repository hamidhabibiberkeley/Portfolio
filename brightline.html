        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>I worked as a UX Design intern for Brightline’s Provider Experience team.</p>
        <p>As Brightline is a digital health startup providing behavioral health services for children and their families,
            most of my internship focused on designing tools for our care providers. I was a key partner in the discovery and design of 2 care initiatives, focused on enabling our providers to efficiently deliver care.</p>    
        <p>All of the showcased initiatives and their designs were shipped and positively received by our providers.</p>
